          On desktop browsers, where we have a fixed vertical scroll bar, this setting is suboptimal because the
          scroll bar is considered a part of the viewport. Consequently, the indicator is positioned slightly right
          of the center. While 100% would solve that problem nicely, it doesn't work for mobile browsers, where the page
          is horizontally briefly larger than the viewport. The indicator would thus jump around while the table is
          sized down to fit the page. Therefore 100vw is considered the lesser of two evils.
