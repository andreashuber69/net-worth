Gain a quick overview of your precious metal and crypto assets!

If you primarily store your wealth in 'unconventional' assets like precious metals and cryptocurrencies, it seems
difficult to get an overview of your current financial situation.

Net Worth aims to make this a little easier. In a nutshell, the application presents your precious metal and
cryptocurrency holdings in a groupable and sortable table, which allows you to quickly see how your net worth is spread
among the different asset types and locations.

## Getting Started

Net Worth runs in your internet browser but works and feels mostly like a conventional desktop application. There are no
logins, no passwords and your data is only ever stored locally on your computer.

While the application should work in most recent internet browsers, for privacy reasons it is recommended to
install either [Brave](https://brave.com), [Iron](https://www.srware.net/iron/) or
[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and point it to <https://andreashuber69.github.io/net-worth>.

> Note: It appears that some versions of **Brave** treat requests to external services as if they are made by cross-site
> trackers. So, if you experience any problems, please deactivate **Brave Shields** and try again. In the
> [Privacy](#privacy) section you can find more information on what kinds of queries are made by the application.

### Installation

In the latest desktop versions of some browsers (e.g. **Brave** and **Chrome**), you have the option to install Net
Worth locally:

![Desktop Installation](./doc/desktop-installation.png)

After the installation, you should see the application icon on your desktop. For further options, you can navigate to
`chrome://apps`:

![Desktop Installation Options](./doc/desktop-installation-options.png)

Alternatively, you can also install the self-contained (i.e. browser-independent)
[desktop variant of Net Worth](https://github.com/andreashuber69/net-worth-desktop/blob/master/README.md#installation).

On recent **Android** phones (and presumably tablets) with the latest version of **Chrome**, you are automatically
prompted to add an icon to your home screen when you visit <https://andreashuber69.github.io/net-worth> for the first
time:

![Phone Installation](./doc/phone-installation.png)

### Usage

![Screenshot](doc/screenshot.png)

In the toolbar on the left there's a menu with the usual suspects **New**, **Open...**, **Save**, **Save As...** and
**About**. On the right, you'll find buttons to add a new asset and refresh as well as controls to change the asset
grouping and the valuation currency.

In the table, clicking on a row representing an asset group will expand/collapse it. For example, in the screenshot
above, the **Silver** group is expanded, such that the grouped assets become visible. Individual assets can be edited
and deleted with the triple-dot menu at the end of each row. Some columns can be sorted by clicking on their headers.

Some table cells reveal more information when hovering over them with the mouse pointer:

- Location for a cryptocurrency: Address (if specified)
- Description: Notes (if specified)
- Unit Value and Quantity, when displaying "Error": Additional error information

### Privacy

- **Data Storage**: The asset details you enter into Net Worth are stored in an application-specific space in your
  browser, so that it can only be accessed when your browser is pointed to
  [https://andreashuber69.github.io/net-worth](https://andreashuber69.github.io/net-worth). Said data can be saved to a
  .assets file on your hard drive such that you can load it again later, much like you can save and load stuff with
  conventional desktop applications. Note that .assets files are **not** encrypted. If you care about privacy, you
  should thus ensure that these files cannot be accessed by anybody else, e.g. by storing them on a password-protected
  encrypted drive. Moreover, you should only use Net Worth on a device where you have a password-protected personal
  account. Finally, it is worth noting that most cloud storage services like e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive, etc. do **not**
  store user data in an encrypted form.
- **Queries**: The application queries precious metal prices and currency exchange rates
  ([quandl.com](https://quandl.com)) plus crypto currency prices ([cryptocompare.com](https://cryptocompare.com)). For
  crypto currencies, you have the option to also track your balance, by specifying a public address instead of a
  quantity. If you choose to do so, the application will also send your public address(es) to an online service like
  e.g. [blockchair.com](https://blockchair.com). All queries are always encrypted (https), but of course the owners of
  the respective services will have access to the contents of the queries (which can be attributed to you via your IP
  address). This is why it is recommended to only use the application via a reputable VPN provider or even TOR.
- **HD Wallets**: Besides normal public addresses, the application also supports so-called xpubs (short for extended
  public keys) for most crypto currencies. To protect your privacy, Net Worth never sends these to external services.
  Instead, balances are queried with normal public addresses derived from an xpub. While this approach reveals as
  little as possible about your wallet, it should be noted that it's trivial to reconstruct the past transaction
  history from the contents of the queries. This is why, again, you should take measures so that the queries are not
  attributable to you, see above.

### Data Provider Request Limits

The application gathers data from various providers, who generously offer their services free of charge. Some of the
providers (like e.g. blockchair.com) heavily limit the number of requests they answer from a given IP address.

#### Asset Prices

This is usually not a problem for asset prices because these can be retrieved with very few requests. If you use a VPN,
it is possible however that the previous user of the same IP address has already exhausted the provider limit and you
therefore get error messages.

#### Crypto Currency Balances

If you allow the application to query your crypto currency balance by providing a public address, the requests are
spaced out such that the provider request limit is not exhausted. Depending on the number of addresses you provide, this
may take substantial time, especially if you provide an xpub of a wallet with many transactions.

## Source Code

The source code and full change history is available at <https://github.com/andreashuber69/net-worth> and
<https://github.com/andreashuber69/net-worth-desktop>. You can also review the code with the developer tools while your
browser is directed to the <https://andreashuber69.github.io/net-worth>.

## Rationale

Net Worth was created because no other freely available site/tool seemed to support both precious metals and crypto
currencies and I was fed up with maintaining an increasingly complex set of Excel sheets.

Net Worth is a so-called Progressive Web Application (PWA). PWAs can be used exactly like conventional web applications
but at the same time are automatically cached locally such that they still load in seconds if the network is slow or even
down. On an increasing number of browsers, especially on mobile platforms, PWAs can now also be added to the home screen
such that they look and feel much like a locally installed app.

The PWA model was chosen due to the following advantages over conventional desktop applications:

- PWAs work on most popular platforms/browsers.
- No installation is required, just surf to <https://andreashuber69.github.io/net-worth> and let your browser handle the
  rest.
- Distribution is straight-forward.

Of course, there are also some (minor) disadvantages:

- It is impossible to overwrite a local file from within a browser without user involvement. The **Save** menu item
  will therefore always create a new file rather than overwrite the originally loaded one. Since browsers typically
  store files in a special Download folder, the user usually needs to manually copy the newly saved file over the one
  she loaded. For an application like Net Worth this should not result in too much of an inconvenience, because files
  are typically changed rarely.
- If a web site attempts to open a new browser window, pop-up blockers sometimes get in the way. Most browsers allow the
  user to authorize exceptions.
